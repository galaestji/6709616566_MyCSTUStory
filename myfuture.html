            🌐In Terms Of Future Work
        </h1>
        <p>
            🍎After graduation, I aim to work as a Software Developer, particularly in a company that develops technology for education. I believe that learning is a key factor in improving people's lives. Additionally, I plan to further my studies in Artificial Intelligence (AI) to enhance my expertise in developing programs that can learn and adapt in the future. I hope that in the next five years, I will be able to develop applications that benefit education and society on a larger scale.
