    <section>
        <h2>🌐Year 1</h2>
        <p>
            🍎It all started with orientation and freshman activities. I was very impressed because I got to meet so many people and formed great friendships. I realized that there were many people more skilled than I am, and it gave me motivation. When the term began, I started studying various subjects. The computer science-related courses I took included web design, introductory C programming, discrete math, and psychology for application design. These courses helped me learn many new things I had never known before.🍎

        <h2>🌐Year 3</h2>
        <p>
            🍎This is the year I should be able to code well and efficiently because it’s the year before I graduate. Major projects and new subjects that I haven’t studied yet will help sharpen my knowledge significantly.🍎

        <h2>🌐Year 4</h2>
        <p>
            🍎This will be my final year at university. It’s the year when I will need to work on my final project or internship. I hope to code effortlessly and possess a wealth of knowledge before leaving the university to enter the workforce.🍎
